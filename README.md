# Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System
### Project Requirements

Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles.


Each color should have:

- A name (you can come up with this name yourself)
- A box displaying the color itself.
- The CSS value used to create the color (in hex, rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), or hsla()).
- An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.

For every font:

- The font name
- A series of styles that you intend to use (for example, styles could include: plain, bold and italic, underlined).
- For each style, include a sentence or series of words to demonstrate the text style (our example site uses the quick brown fox…).

For each page element, include:

- A page element name (for example, “Subheading”).
- All style rules (for example, font-weight: 700).
